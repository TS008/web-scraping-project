## 🛠️ Technical Solution

### 🔧 What Worked
The **Workday API Scraper** (`workday_api_scraper.py`) was the winning solution:

1. **API Discovery**: Successfully identified the correct Workday API endpoint
2. **Authentication**: Handled API authentication without CSRF tokens
3. **Pagination**: Automatically paginated through all 11 pages of results
4. **Data Extraction**: Extracted complete job information including:
   - Job titles
   - Locations
   - Posting dates
   - Direct job URLs
   - Company information

### 🚫 What Didn't Work
- **Enhanced Scraper**: Failed due to 422 API errors and ChromeDriver network issues
- **Simple HTML Scraper**: Failed because the website loads job data dynamically via JavaScript
- **Selenium Approach**: Network connectivity issues prevented ChromeDriver download

### 🎯 The Winning Strategy
```python
# Successful API payload format
{
    "appliedFacets": {},
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "searchText": ""
}
```

**API Endpoint**: `https://pultegroup.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/pultegroup/PGI/jobs`
